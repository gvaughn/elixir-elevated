# ElixirElevated

## ElixirConf 2014

This codebase served in my ["Elixir Elevated"](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/4124-elixirconf2014-elixir-elevated) talk at ElixirConf 2014.
The ["slides"](https://speakerdeck.com/gvaughn/elixir-elevated-the-ups-and-downs-of-otp) are at SpeakerDeck
The exact code presented there can be found on the [elixirconf2014 branch](https://github.com/gvaughn/elixir_elevated/tree/elixirconf2014).

## Concept

This is a learning exercise for Elixir multi-process coding. A while
back I attempted an elevator kata in ruby. I realized it is inherently
concurrent and never completed it. Now that I'm learning Elixir, it
seems a great match for an intermediate Elixir practice app.
