# ElixirElevated

** Concept **

This is a learning exercise for Elixir multi-process coding. A while
back I attempted an elevator kata in ruby. I realized it is inherently
concurrent and never completed it. Now that I'm learning Elixir, it
seems a great match for an intermediate Elixir practice app.

** ElixirConf 2014 **

This served as an example during my "Elixir Elevated" talk. You can
advance through the stages of the app on this branch and/or follow along
with the tags (s1 .. sn) via "git checkout #{tag_name}"
