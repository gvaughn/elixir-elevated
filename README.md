# ElixirElevated

## ElixirConf 2014

This codebase served in my ["Elixir Elevated"](http://www.slideshare.net/GregVaughn/elixir-elevated) talk at ElixirConf 2014.
The exact code presented there can be found on the [elixirconf2014 branch](https://github.com/gvaughn/elixir_elevated/tree/elixirconf2014).


## Concept

This is a learning exercise for Elixir multi-process coding. A while
back I attempted an elevator kata in ruby. I realized it is inherently
concurrent and never completed it. Now that I'm learning Elixir, it
seems a great match for an intermediate Elixir practice app.

## TODO

* Use custom via process name registration
* Flesh out VisualStatus
