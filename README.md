# ElixirElevated

** Concept **

This is a learning exercise for Elixir multi-process coding. A while
back I attempted an elevator kata in ruby. I realized it is inherently
concurrent and never completed it. Now that I'm learning Elixir, it
seems a great match for an intermediate Elixir practice app.

** TODO **

* Test with shared local Elevator.Status across banks
* Use custom via process name registration
* Flesh out VisualStatus
